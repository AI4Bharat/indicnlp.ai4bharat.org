      <description>IndicCorp has been developed by discovering and scraping thousands of web sources - primarily news, magazines and books, over a duration of several months.
IndicCorp is one of the largest publicly-available corpora for Indian languages. It has also been used to train our released models which have obtained state-of-the-art performance on many tasks.
Corpus Format The corpus is a single large text file containing one sentence per line. The publicly released version is randomly shuffled, untokenized and deduplicated.</description>

      <description>IndicWav2Vec is a multilingual speech model pretrained on 40 Indian langauges. This model represents the largest diversity of Indian languages in the pool of multilingual speech models. We fine-tune this model for downstream ASR for 9 languages and obtain state-of-the-art results on 3 public benchmarks, namely MUCS, MSR and OpenSLR.
As part of IndicWav2Vec we create largest publicly available corpora for 40 languages from 4 different language families. We also trained state-of-the-art ASR models for 9 Indian languages.</description>

      <description>IndicBART is a multilingual, sequence-to-sequence pre-trained model focusing on Indic languages and English. It currently supports 11 Indian languages and is based on the mBART architecture. You can use IndicBART model to build natural language generation applications for Indian languages by finetuning the model with supervised training data for tasks like machine translation, summarization, question generation, etc. Some salient features of the IndicBART are:
 Supported languages: Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi, Odiya, Punjabi, Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu and English.</description>

      <description>To thoroughly evaluate language models on Indian languages, we need a robust NLU benchmark consisting of a wide variety of tasks and covering all the Indian languages. IndicGLUE is a natural language understanding benchmark that we propose. It consists of 6 tasks which we describe in the next section.
In addition, we also compile a list of additional evaluations which comprises of tasks based on publicly-available datasets.

      <description>IndicNLG suite is a collection of datasets for benchmarking Natural Language Generation (NLG) for 11 Indic languages spanning five diverse NLG tasks. The datasets were created using a combination of crawling websites, machine translation, n-gram count and regular expression based cleaning . Overall, the suite contains about 8.5M examples across all languages and tasks and is the largest multilingual NLG dataset to date as well as the first of its kind for Indic languages.</description>

      <description>fastText is a subword-aware word embedding model. It is particularly well-suited for Indian languages due to their highly agglutinative morphology. We train fastText models on our IndicNLP Corpora and evaluate them on a set of tasks to measure its performance.
Our fastText models are available for 11 Indian languages: Assamese, Bengali, English, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu.
Usage To use our fastText models, first download them. Next, install the fastText library:</description>

      <description>We are working towards building a better ecosystem for Indian languages. To this end, we are building various resources and models for Indian languages:
 IndicCorp: A lot of NLP models require a large amount of training data, which most of the Indian languages lack. In this project, we develop a large-scale Indic corpora by intesively crawling the web. The corpora that we build has a total of 8.9 billion tokens and covers 12 major Indian languages - making it the largest public corpus for most of the Indian languages.</description>
